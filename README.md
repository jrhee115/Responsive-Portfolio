# Responsive-Portfolio
This assignment we were told to make a responsive portfolio using bootstrap.
Using bootstrap I add the navbar, a responsive layout, and image. It was functional, the navbar was consistant on each page. I added 3 tabs, home. about, and contact which was able to link to each other. I was about to add a bio, name, and added my social media.
